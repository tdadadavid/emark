    // This project is a website for
// Marketing items ...
    // The Actions that can be Done //
// then the user
// can check for an item in a category
// check price,add-to-cart or
// remove-from-cart(that means
// each user should have an id-cart....
// then tell that ou want to purchase
// then we should send an email
// that the purchase is valid
// *and the user should have a link his/her email...
// the user can also choose to get notified
// and also cancel not to be notified
//the user can also add to wishlist
// we should be able to advertise for customers
// who would use our eKiosk to sell
// their stuffs(and they be rated by the buyers)

    // The categories of items //
// the items are to be put into category
// like pot
    // size
    // color
    // type(pressure-pot,normal type)
    // amount

    // The categories of user //
// First party user(Has bought 10things from
//this website in a month)
// Second party user(Has bought 8 things from
//this website for a month)
// Third party user(Has bought 5 things from this
//website for a month)

    // Other //
// Every user should have a log of what has been
// bought from my website
//the user(for those who are registered)
//can be able to open a kiosk to sell thier
//products ......
//  there would be age verification and this
//would be based on the user's residential state
//or country policies//


/* Database structure
--> there would be a table for all who register has
1 . user: they are customers who also use our kiosk
2. Customers: they are registered buyers from us

    similarities
*they both enjoy discounts as their star or point rises

    differences
*The customers would have slower points and
*The users would have faster points rate

--> there would be like a history or log table
for each user and customer to keep check
of their activities on the site
